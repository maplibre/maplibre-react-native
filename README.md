_React Native library for creating maps
with [MapLibre Native for Android & iOS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native)._

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for the new architecture with v10 is only through the interoperability layer. There are still quite a few
> [issues](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-react-native/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3ABug%20label%3A%22Architecture%3A%20New%22),
> when used with the new architecture. Switch to the v11 alpha releases on the
> [`alpha`](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-react-native/tree/alpha) branch for better support of the new
> architecture.

This project originated as a fork of [rnmapbox](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps), a community-maintained
React Native library for building maps with the Mapbox iOS and Android mobile SDKs. The original library
supported both Mapbox and MapLibre for some time, but as the MapLibre and Mapbox SDKs have
diverged, it has become necessary to separate the projects into specific wrappers by underlying renderer.
