# Getting Started

This guide gets you started with MapLibre in your Expo or React Native project.

:::danger[Limited Support for New Architecture]

Support for the new architecture with v10 is only through the interoperability layer. There are still quite a few
[issues](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-react-native/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3ABug%20label%3A%22Architecture%3A%20New%22),
when used with the new architecture. Switch to the v11 alpha releases on the
[`alpha`](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-react-native/tree/alpha) branch for better support of the new
architecture.
