# Migrating to v11

MapLibre React Native v11 is the first release to only support the new architecture. As this required significant changes to the implementation, the APIs where also improved and are based upon MapLibre GL.

## Changes to `MapView` Component

### Android View is now `GLSurfaceView` by default

On Android the `MapView` now uses `GLSurfaceView` per default instead of `TextureView` for native rendering. This aligns with the default of the native SDKs, this switch is [pre-dating MapLibre](https://blog.mapbox.com/asynchronous-rendering-on-android-831722ac1837) and was never propagated to the React Native wrapper. To fall back to the `TextureView` set the `androidView="texture"` prop.

### Removed Props

The following props have been removed from the `MapView` without replacement:

- `localizeLabels`: This was used in conjuction with Mapbox specific map styles for toggling localization, MapLibre aims to be vendor-agnostic and the prop has therefore been removed
- `regionWillChangeDebounceTime` & `regionDidChangeDebounceTime`: Debouncing should be handled in the app code if needed

### Ornament Props

All ornaments (attribution, logo, compass) use an aligned API now. Enable/disable the visibility with the `attribution`/`logo`/`compass` boolean props. Position them with the `attributionPosition`/`logoPosition`/`compassPosition` props which only accepts an object with `top`/`bottom` and `left`/`right` properties.

### `contentInset`

Now uses unified `ViewPadding` type:

```diff
<MapView
-  contentInset={[16, 16, 16, 16]}
+  contentInset={{ top: 16, right: 16, bottom: 16, left: 16 }}
/>
```

### Control Props

Simplified control by dropping the `enabled` suffix:

```diff
<MapView
-  scrollEnabled={false}
+  scroll={false}
-  zoomEnabled={false}
+  zoom={false}
-  rotateEnabled={false}
+  rotate={false}
-  pitchEnabled={false}
+  pitch={false}
/>
```

### Events

Events now follows the pattern of `NativeSyntheticEvent` and passes the payload in the `nativeEvent` property.

### Imperative Methods on `MapRef`

Imperative methods have been aligned with the MapLibre GL API as far as possible.

- Renamed methods:
  - `getVisibleBounds()` -> `getBounds()`
  - `getPointInView()` -> `project()`
    - Params now uses `{ longitude, latitude }` as params
  - `getCoordinateFromView()` -> `unproject()`
    - Params now uses `{ locationX, locationY }` as params
- Unified methods:
  - `queryRenderedFeaturesAtPoint()` & `queryRenderedFeaturesInRect()` -> `queryRenderedFeatures()`
    - Now instead of passing pixel coordinates, geographic coordinates are being required to query
- More complete API by adding:
  - `getBearing()`
  - `getPitch()`
  - `getViewState()`

## Changes to `Camera` Component

### Changes to Camera Stop Props

The prop was renamed and the structure was aligned with MapLibre GL and `react-map-gl`:

```diff
<Camera
-  centerCoordinate={[longitude, latitude]}
+  center={{ longitude, latitude }}
-  zoomLevel={10}
+  zoom={10}
- heading={15}
+  bearing={15}
  pitch={30}
-  animationDuration={2000}
+  duration={2000}
-  animationMode="flyTo"
+  easing="fly"
/>
```

String Literal `CameraAnimationMode` has been renamed to `CameraEasing` and changed as follows:

- `moveTo` -> `undefined`
- `linearTo` -> `linear`
- `easeTo` -> `ease`
- `flyTo` -> `fly`

### Prop `defaultSettings` changed to `initialViewState`

The prop was renamed and the structure was aligned with MapLibre GL and `react-map-gl`:

```diff
<Camera
-  defaultSettings={{
+  initialViewState={{
-    centerCoordinate: [longitude, latitude],
+    center: { longitude, latitude },
-    zoomLevel: 10,
+    zoom: 10,
-    heading: 15,
+    bearing: 15
    pitch: 30,
-    bounds: {
-      ne: [east, north],
-      sw: [west, south],
-      paddingTop: 16,
-      paddingRight: 16,
-      paddingBottom: 16,
-      paddingLeft: 16,
-    },
+    bounds: [west, south, east, north],
+    padding: { top: 16, right: 16, bottom: 16, left: 16 },
  }}
/>
```

### Follow Prop Changes

The `followUserLocation` and `followUserMode` prop has been unified to `trackUserLocation`.

The enum `UserTrackingMode` has been replaced by the String Literal `TrackUserLocation`:

- `normal` -> `default`
- `compass` -> `heading`
- `course` -> `course`

The `follow` props to control the camera during tracking have been removed in favor of the default camera stop props:

```diff
<Camera
-  followUserLocation
-  followUserMode="normal"
+  trackUserLocation="default"
-  followZoomLevel={15}
+  zoom={15}
-  followHeading={0}
+  bearing={0}
-  followPitch={45}
+  pitch={45}
/>
```

### Unified use of String Literals

### Imperative Methods on `CameraRef`

Imperative methods have been aligned with the MapLibre GL API as far as possible.

- `setCamera()` -> `setStop()`
- `moveTo()` -> `jumpTo()`
- More complete API by adding:
  - `easeTo()`
